=== Recommendations

==== Recommendation 1: Proactive Quality Disclosure

It is RECOMMENDED that data providers proactively document quality limitations and known issues rather than waiting for claims to arise. This promotes transparency and manages expectations.

==== Recommendation 2: Insurance Coverage

Organizations publishing geospatial data for critical applications SHOULD maintain appropriate liability insurance and document coverage using the InsuranceInfo class.

==== Recommendation 3: Regular Review

Liability metadata SHOULD be reviewed and updated regularly, particularly when data is updated or when legal frameworks change.
