== Conformance

This specification defines the following conformance classes:

* */conf/core* - Core requirements for liability and claims representation
* */conf/provenance* - Integration with W3C PROV-O for provenance tracking  
* */conf/quality* - Quality assessment frameworks based on ISO 19157 and W3C DQV
* */conf/legal-frameworks* - Support for multiple legal jurisdictions and frameworks
* */conf/claims-management* - Requirements for documenting and tracking claims

Conformance with this specification shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in Annex C (normative). The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are specified in ISO 19105.

Implementations may choose to conform to one or more conformance classes. Core conformance requires implementation of the */conf/core* class. Other conformance classes provide additional capabilities that may be required for specific use cases.

All requirements-classes and conformance-classes described in this document are owned by the standard(s) identified in this document.
