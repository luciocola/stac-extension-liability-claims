== Conceptual Model

=== Overview

This clause defines the conceptual model for liability and claims management in geospatial data systems. The model is based on object-oriented principles following ISO 19103 and uses UML class diagrams to represent concepts and their relationships.

The conceptual model consists of five main packages:

1. *Core Liability Package*: Fundamental concepts for liability attribution
2. *Claims Management Package*: Classes for documenting and tracking claims
3. *Provenance Package*: Integration with W3C PROV-O  
4. *Quality Assessment Package*: Data quality frameworks
5. *Legal Framework Package*: Legal jurisdiction and regulatory concepts

=== Core Liability Package

The Core Liability Package defines the fundamental concepts for representing liability attribution in geospatial data products.

==== LiabilityExtension Class

The `LiabilityExtension` class is the root class for all liability-related metadata associated with a geospatial data product.

=== Implementation Considerations

Implementations of this conceptual model MAY use different serialization formats including:

* JSON Schema (for STAC and JSON APIs)
* XML Schema (for OGC web services)
* RDF/OWL (for semantic web applications)
* Relational databases (for data management systems)

Regardless of implementation format, conforming implementations SHALL maintain the semantics defined in this conceptual model.
