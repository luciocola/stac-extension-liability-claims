== Legal Frameworks

=== Overview

Liability operates within specific legal and regulatory contexts that vary by jurisdiction and application domain. This clause provides guidance on documenting legal frameworks without attempting to provide legal advice.

[NOTE]
====
This specification provides technical mechanisms for documenting legal frameworks. It does NOT provide legal advice. Organizations should consult qualified legal professionals regarding liability obligations and risk management strategies.

=== Common Legal Frameworks

The following legal frameworks commonly apply to geospatial data liability:

==== Professional Liability Frameworks

Professional liability (errors and omissions) applies when licensed professionals provide geospatial services:

* **Surveying**: Licensed land surveyors operate under professional standards boards
* **Engineering**: Professional engineers are licensed and governed by state/provincial boards
* **GIS**: Some jurisdictions have GIS professional certifications with associated standards

Documentation should include:

* Professional license numbers
* Applicable professional standards
* Professional liability insurance details

==== Data Quality Standards

International and national standards provide objective quality criteria:

* **ISO 19157**: Geographic Information - Data Quality
* **ASPRS**: Positional Accuracy Standards for Digital Geospatial Data
* **FGDC**: Federal Geographic Data Committee Standards (US)
* **INSPIRE**: Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe

==== Product Liability

Product liability law may apply when geospatial data is distributed as a commercial product:

* Implied warranties of merchantability
* Fitness for particular purpose
* Strict liability for defective products

==== Contract Law

Contractual agreements often define liability terms:

* Service level agreements (SLAs)
* Data licensing agreements
* Terms of service for data platforms

==== Negligence and Tort Law

Negligence claims require demonstrating:

* Duty of care owed
* Breach of that duty
* Causation
* Damages

Documenting quality standards and professional conduct helps establish duty of care.

==== Privacy and Data Protection

Privacy laws affect geospatial data containing personal information:

* **GDPR**: EU General Data Protection Regulation
* **CCPA**: California Consumer Privacy Act
* **Various national**: Data protection laws worldwide

=== Limitation of Liability Clauses

Providers often limit liability through:

* **Disclaimer clauses**: "Data provided as-is"
* **Liability caps**: Maximum dollar amounts
* **Use restrictions**: Prohibiting specific applications
* **Time limits**: Statutes of limitations

Such limitations must be:

* Clearly communicated
* Legally enforceable in applicable jurisdictions
* Reasonable given the circumstances

=== Indemnification

Indemnification clauses allocate risk between parties. Common patterns:

* **Provider indemnifies user**: For defects in data
* **User indemnifies provider**: For misuse of data
* **Mutual indemnification**: Each party protects the other

Implementations SHOULD document indemnification terms using the `indemnification_clause` property.

=== Insurance Considerations

Professional liability insurance (Errors & Omissions) covers:

* Defense costs for claims
* Settlements or judgments
* Professional advice and services

Documentation SHOULD include:

* Insurance provider
* Policy numbers
* Coverage limits
* Policy period

=== Multi-Jurisdiction Scenarios

International data sharing raises complex jurisdictional issues:

1. **Conflict of Laws**: Which jurisdiction's law applies?
2. **Enforcement**: How are judgments enforced across borders?
3. **Data Sovereignty**: National laws restricting data movement
4. **Harmonization**: Varying standards across jurisdictions

For multi-jurisdiction data:

* Document all applicable jurisdictions
* Reference international standards where possible
* Clearly specify governing law in agreements
* Consider jurisdiction-specific metadata
