For the purposes of this document, the following additional terms and definitions apply.

=== liability

legal responsibility for the consequences of an act or omission, especially in relation to damage or loss caused by geospatial data quality issues

[.source]
<<iso19157>>

NOTE: In the context of geospatial data, liability typically relates to fitness-for-purpose, data quality representations, and professional standards of care.

=== claim

formal assertion or demand for remedy based on alleged liability arising from geospatial data quality, fitness-for-purpose, or professional standards

NOTE: Claims may involve financial damages, required corrections, or other remedies.

=== provenance

information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing, which can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness

[.source]
<<provO>>

NOTE: Provenance tracking provides the evidence trail for liability attribution.

=== data quality

degree to which a set of characteristics of data fulfills stated requirements

[.source]
<<iso19157>>

NOTE: Quality assessment forms the technical basis for many liability claims.

=== responsible party

individual or organization having a specific role or responsibility with respect to geospatial data

[.source]
<<iso19115-1>>

NOTE: Responsible parties may include data collectors, processors, publishers, or users.

=== jurisdiction

territory, geographical area, or conceptual domain over which legal authority extends

NOTE: Liability operates within specific legal jurisdictions with different laws and standards.

=== fitness for purpose

degree to which data has characteristics that enable it to satisfy stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions

<<iso19157>>

NOTE: Liability often hinges on whether data was fit for its intended purpose.

=== affected party

individual, organization, or legal entity that has been or may be impacted by geospatial data quality issues or associated liabilities

NOTE: Affected parties may include data users, property owners, government agencies, or the general public.

=== evidence chain

documented trail of evidence supporting a liability claim or quality assessment, including source data, processing records, and validation results

NOTE: Evidence chains rely on complete provenance tracking.

=== legal framework

system of laws, regulations, standards, and professional codes that govern liability for geospatial data products

NOTE: Legal frameworks vary by jurisdiction and application domain.

=== conformance result

outcome of applying a conformance test to assess whether data or services meet specified quality requirements

[.source]
<<iso19157>>

NOTE: Conformance results provide objective evidence for quality claims.

=== agent

[.source]
<<provO>>

NOTE: Agents are the actors in provenance graphs who may bear liability.

=== activity

something that occurs over a period of time and acts upon or with entities; it may include consuming, processing, transforming, modifying, relocating, using, or generating entities

=== entity

[.source]
<<provO>>

NOTE: In this specification, entities are typically geospatial data products or their components.

=== attribution

[.source]
<<provO>>

NOTE: Attribution establishes who is responsible for data products, forming the basis for liability.
