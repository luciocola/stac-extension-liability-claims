== Quality Assessment Framework

=== Overview

This clause defines requirements for integrating data quality assessment with liability frameworks. Quality assessment provides the technical evidence basis for evaluating liability claims and determining fitness-for-purpose.

==== Requirement 9: Quality Measurement Documentation

[requirement,uri="http://www.opengis.net/spec/liability-claims/1.1/req/quality/measurements"]
====
[%metadata]
label:: /req/quality/measurements
subject:: Quality assessment
part:: Quality assessments SHALL document individual measurements using the QualityMeasurement class.
part:: Each measurement SHALL identify the quality element, measure, and evaluation method.
part:: Measurements SHOULD reference standardized quality measures from ISO 19157 where applicable.
====

==== Requirement 10: Conformance Testing

[requirement,uri="http://www.opengis.net/spec/liability-claims/1.1/req/quality/conformance"]
====
[%metadata]
label:: /req/quality/conformance
subject:: Quality assessment
part:: Implementations MAY document conformance to specifications using the ConformanceResult class.
part:: Conformance results SHALL indicate pass/fail status and reference the tested specification.
====

==== Requirement 11: Assessor Attribution

[requirement,uri="http://www.opengis.net/spec/liability-claims/1.1/req/quality/assessor"]
====
[%metadata]
label:: /req/quality/assessor
subject:: Quality assessment
part:: Quality assessments SHALL identify the assessor (person or organization conducting the assessment).
part:: Assessor information SHALL include contact details as specified in ISO 19115-1.
====

=== Integration with ISO 19157

This specification builds upon ISO 19157:2013 Geographic Information - Data Quality. Implementations SHALL:

* Use ISO 19157 quality elements where applicable (completeness, logical consistency, positional accuracy, temporal quality, thematic accuracy, usability)
* Reference ISO 19157 quality measures using standardized identifiers
* Document evaluation methods consistent with ISO 19157 guidance

=== Integration with W3C DQV

Implementations MAY express quality measurements using W3C Data Quality Vocabulary (DQV). When using DQV:

* Quality measurements map to `dqv:QualityMeasurement` class
* Quality metrics map to `dqv:Metric` class
* Quality dimensions from ISO 19157 map to `dqv:Dimension` class

=== Quality Dimensions

The following quality dimensions from ISO 19157 are particularly relevant for liability assessment:

[cols="1,3",width="90%",options="header"]
|===
|Dimension |Relevance to Liability

|Positional Accuracy
|Critical for land parcel boundaries, infrastructure planning, emergency response

|Thematic Accuracy
|Essential for classification-based decisions (land use, environmental conditions)

|Temporal Quality
|Important for time-sensitive applications (disaster response, surveillance)

|Completeness
|Affects fitness-for-purpose; missing data can lead to incorrect decisions

|Logical Consistency
|Data integrity issues can propagate errors through analysis workflows

|Usability
|Metadata quality and documentation affect appropriate use
|===

=== Quality Reporting Requirements

Conforming implementations SHALL report quality in a manner that enables liability assessment:

1. *Comprehensiveness*: Cover all relevant quality dimensions for the intended use
2. *Objectivity*: Use reproducible evaluation methods
3. *Transparency*: Document evaluation methods and limitations
4. *Comparability*: Use standardized measures enabling comparison
5. *Timeliness*: Conduct assessments at appropriate intervals

=== Example Quality Documentation

The following example shows quality documentation for positional accuracy:
