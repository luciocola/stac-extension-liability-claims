== Annex A: Use Cases

=== Use Case 1: Emergency Flood Response

*Scenario*: A municipal emergency management agency uses aerial LiDAR data to model flood risk and evacuate residents during a major storm event.

*Liability Concerns*:

* Accuracy of elevation data affects flood predictions
* Timeliness of data collection vs. storm event
* Professional qualifications of hydrological modelers
* Communication of uncertainty to decision-makers

*Requirements Addressed*:

* Core liability framework declaration (professional standards for surveyors and engineers)
* Quality assessment showing DEM accuracy meets flood modeling requirements
* Complete provenance from LiDAR acquisition through flood model
* Clear attribution to licensed professionals
* Documentation of model assumptions and limitations

*Outcome*: When questioned about evacuation decisions, agency can demonstrate due diligence through documented data quality, professional credentials, and clear communication of uncertainty.

=== Use Case 2: Infrastructure Planning Litigation

*Scenario*: A property owner sues a municipality claiming that incorrect drainage assessment led to flood damage of their new building. The assessment was based on geospatial data.

*Liability Concerns*:

* Was the elevation data fit for drainage engineering purposes?
* Were professional standards followed in the assessment?
* Was the data current at time of assessment?
* Were known limitations communicated?

*Requirements Addressed*:

* Claims management - formal claim documented with parties, damages, evidence
* Quality documentation showing limitations of source data
* Provenance chain from survey to engineering assessment
* Professional credentials of engineers conducting assessment
* Legal framework (professional engineering standards, building codes)

*Outcome*: Complete liability documentation enables forensic analysis. If professional standards were followed and limitations communicated, provider may avoid liability. If standards were not met, documentation supports settlement negotiations.

=== Use Case 3: Defense Intelligence Sharing

*Scenario*: Military intelligence agencies share geospatial intelligence products across allied nations for joint operations planning.

*Liability Concerns*:

* Multi-jurisdiction data sharing across sovereignty boundaries
* Classification levels and security clearances
* Attribution to specific intelligence agencies
* Quality standards for operational planning
* Rules of engagement based on geospatial data

*Requirements Addressed*:

* Multi-jurisdiction legal frameworks
* Security classification metadata
* Clear attribution chains through coalition partners
* Quality assessment against defense standards
* Provenance showing intelligence sources and methods (at appropriate classification)

*Outcome*: Clear liability documentation supports informed decision-making while respecting classification and sovereignty concerns.

=== Use Case 4: Insurance Claim Assessment

*Scenario*: Insurance company uses satellite imagery and LiDAR to assess property damage claims after a wildfire.

*Liability Concerns*:

* Accuracy of damage assessment affects claim payments
* Temporal alignment (pre-fire vs post-fire imagery dates)
* Professional qualifications of damage assessors
* Dispute resolution if property owner challenges assessment

*Requirements Addressed*:

* Claims management for disputed assessments
* Quality documentation (resolution, accuracy, temporal)
* Provenance from satellite acquisition through damage calculation
* Professional credentials of assessors
* Evidence chain for legal proceedings

*Outcome*: Documented assessment methodology and quality supports fair claim resolution and withstands legal scrutiny if challenged.

=== Use Case 5: Environmental Impact Litigation

*Scenario*: Environmental group uses satellite time-series analysis to document illegal deforestation and bring legal action against landowner.

*Liability Concerns*:

* Accuracy of classification (forest vs cleared)
* Change detection methodology validity
* Professional qualifications of analysts
* Chain of custody for evidence
* Peer review and scientific standards

*Requirements Addressed*:

* Legal framework (environmental law, scientific evidence standards)
* Quality assessment (classification accuracy, change detection validation)
* Provenance showing analysis methodology
* Professional credentials of scientists
* Evidence chain meeting legal admissibility standards

*Outcome*: Rigorous documentation of data quality and methodology supports evidence admissibility. Peer review and professional credentials establish scientific credibility.
