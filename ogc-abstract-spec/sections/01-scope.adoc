== Scope

This Abstract Specification Topic defines a conceptual model for representing liability, legal accountability, and quality claims associated with geospatial data products. The scope includes:

* Conceptual data model for liability attribution and claims management
* Requirements for documenting legal frameworks and jurisdictions applicable to geospatial data
* Integration patterns with provenance tracking systems (W3C PROV-O)
* Quality assessment frameworks for liability contexts (based on ISO 19157 and W3C DQV)
* Mechanisms for tracking affected parties, damages, and evidence chains
* Support for multiple legal jurisdictions and regulatory frameworks
* Conformance classes and requirements for implementation

This specification is applicable to:

* Geospatial data products used in critical decision-making contexts
* Systems requiring accountability and audit trails for data quality
* Applications where data quality has legal or financial implications
* Emergency response and defense applications requiring clear data attribution
* Insurance and legal proceedings involving geospatial evidence
* Any system implementing the STAC Liability and Claims Extension

The specification defines abstract requirements and conceptual models. It does not prescribe specific implementation technologies, though examples are provided for common formats including JSON Schema, RDF/OWL, and XML.

This specification does *not* cover:

* Specific legal advice or interpretation of liability laws (consult legal professionals)
* Detailed procedures for conducting data quality assessments (see ISO 19157)
* Complete provenance tracking specifications (see W3C PROV-O)
* Catalog service implementation details (see OGC API specifications)
* Software liability or licensing terms (separate domain)
